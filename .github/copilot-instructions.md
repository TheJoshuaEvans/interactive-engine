# Echo Console App

Use this command to run the wizard emergency game:
```
PYTHONPATH=src uv run wizard-emergency.py
```

"uv" is used for python version management. "uv" documentation can be found here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv

The application must be run from the project root directory - it is NOT globally installed.

A "dinkus" is a typographical device used to indicate a section break or scene change within a chapter of a book, and is used in this project to indicate a "line break" because it is extremely funny.
